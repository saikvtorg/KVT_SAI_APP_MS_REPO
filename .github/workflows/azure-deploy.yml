# Notes:
# - This workflow only builds and deploys the JAR using the publish profile. It does NOT modify App Settings or run database migrations.
# - Required repository secrets: AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE and AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME.
# - For DB migrations, run Flyway or sqlcmd manually against Azure SQL, or add a separate, secured CI job later.
